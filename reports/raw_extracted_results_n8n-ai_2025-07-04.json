Next steps Build an AI chat agent with n8n# Welcome to the introductory tutorial for building AI workflows with n8n. Whether you have used n8n before, or this is your first time, we will show you how the building blocks of AI workflows fit together and construct a working AI-powered chat agent which you can easily customize for your own purposes. Many people find it easier to take in new information in video format. This tutorial is based on one of n8n's popular videos, linked below. Watch the video or read the steps here, or both! What you will need# n8n: For this tutorial we recommend using the n8n cloud service - there is a free trial for new users! For a self hosted service, refer to the installation pages. Credentials for a chat model: This tutorial uses OpenAI, but you can easily use DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Groq, Azure, and others (see the sub-nodes documentation for more). What you will learn# AI concepts in n8n How to use the AI Agent node Working with Chat input Connecting with AI models Customising input Observing the conversation Adding persistence AI concepts in n8n# If you're already familiar with AI, feel free to skip this section. This is a basic introduction to AI concepts and how they can be used in n8n workflows. An AI agent builds on Large Language Models (LLMs), which generate text based on input by predicting the next word. While LLMs only process input to produce output, AI agents add goal-oriented functionality. They can use tools, process their outputs, and make decisions to complete tasks and solve problems. In n8n, the AI agent is represented as a node with some extra connections. Feature\tLLM\tAI Agent Core Capability\tText generation\tGoal-oriented task completion Decision-Making\tNone\tYes Uses Tools/APIs\tNo\tYes Workflow Complexity\tSingle-step\tMulti-step Scope\tGenerates language\tPerforms complex, real-world tasks Example\tLLM generating a paragraph\tAn agent scheduling an appointment By incorporating the AI agent as a node, n8n can combine AI-driven steps with traditional programming for efficient, real-world workflows. For instance, simpler tasks, like validating an email address, do not require AI, whereas a complex tasks, like processing the content of an email or dealing with multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio), are excellent uses of an AI agent. 1. Create a new workflow# When you open n8n, you'll see either: An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow. The Workflows list on the Overview page. Select the  button to create a new workflow. 2. Add a trigger node# Every workflow needs somewhere to start. In n8n these are called 'trigger nodes'. For this workflow, we want to start with a chat node. Select Add first step or press Tab to open the node menu. Search for Chat Trigger. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search. Select Chat Trigger to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node. Close the node details view (Select Back to canvas) to return to t"

I did the beginners course and promptly took an automation WAY beyond my skill level. Robin Tindall @robm n8n is a beast for automation. self-hosting and low-code make it a dev‚Äôs dream. if you‚Äôre not automating yet, you‚Äôre working too hard. Anderoav @Anderoav I've said it many times. But I'll say it again. n8n is the GOAT. Anything is possible with n8n. You just need some technical knowledge + imagination. I'm actually looking to start a side project. Just to have an excuse to use n8n more üòÖ Maxim Poulsen @maximpoulsen It blows my mind. I was hating on no-code tools my whole life, but n8n changed everything. Made a Slack agent that can basically do everything, in half an hour. Felix Leber @felixleber I just have to say, n8n's integration with third-party services is absolutely mind-blowing. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for automation. So many tasks become a breeze, and I can quickly validate and implement my ideas without any hassle. Nanbing @1ronben Found the holy grail of automation yesterday... Yesterday I tried n8n and it blew my mind ü§Ø What would've taken me 3 days to code from scratch? Done in 2 hours. The best part? If you still want to get your hands dirty with code (because let's be honest, we developers can't help ourselves üòÖ), you can just drop in custom code nodes. Zero restrictions.
